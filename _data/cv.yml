  contents:
    - title: Explanability for Optimization
      items:
        - What makes a solution optimal? For a given decision, can we describe the entire region of objective weights and constraint parameters for which this decision is optimal?
        - What would have led to a different decision? Can we derive counterfactual explanations for stakeholders that specify how much the model’s parameters would have needed to change for an alternative, desired solution to be optimal instead?
    - title: Decision-Making under Uncertainty
      items:
        - Largely focused on Robust and Distributinally Robust Satisficing - a paradigm shift from optimality to satisficing; that is, finding solutions that are "good enough".
        - My research interests in these topics lie in tractable formulations and the integration of data-driven techniques to enable better decision making

    Outside of academia, I enjoy staying active and spending time outdoors - some of my favourite activities include dragonboating, hiking and weightlifting. I also deeply enjoy listening to rock (music, not the actor, that would be strange) and reading mangas!
