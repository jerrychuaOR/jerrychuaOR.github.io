summary: Given a feasible solution to an optimization problem, the inverse-feasible region (IFR) describes the set of objective function parameters that renders this solution optimal. For linear and convex optimization problems, the inverse-feasible region of a solution can be defined using standard duality-based reformulations. However, the inverse-feasible region of discrete optimization problems is much more difficult to characterize. In this talk, we propose a novel approach for constructing inner approximations of the IFR that bypasses the computational bottlenecks of exact and outer approximation methods. Our approach, based on separating hyperplanes and continuous relaxations, leads to meaningful and improved inner approximations. We demonstrate our findings in a set of numerical experiments for solving inverse binary optimization problems.
